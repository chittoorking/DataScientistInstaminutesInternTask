   No sir entrepreneurship No  but the highest studies many of the companies Tcs also provide like conc simultaneously highest studies So that may also be a very good option   Okay for example you have got you have got the offer from Tcs Or at the same time Meanwhile you're getting the better offer than Tcs from another organization which is not a tier one organization but tier two organization but the packages just develop what we are offering then what you will do?   a sir I compare both the companies in terms of the   defiantly I’ve told the tcs is the tier one and you've got the offer from tier two it means the startup or midsize company with the package for example, we are giving you four lakh they are giving you eight lakh in that case what do you do?    Sir I choose Tcs only because Tcs is like almost hundred and fifty years old company so it it has a very good job security I have talked to many of my friends who are in Tcs and they say that Tcs gives a very good work life balance I've also participated in smart India hackathons of which ahh in one we also got to the finals   Okay sir ah so ah firstly a we will the will like a this for example of how how many columns are there for example, I take disk of fifty the maximum we take a fifty and then now we take dice   Thankyou so much sir   Good afternoon   Good afternoon sir   All prepare   Yes sir   Okay Tell us which other campus interviews Have you appeared for and what has been the results?   So I have interviewed for darnet, which is an depor only and I got selected for it   implement Snakes and Ladders using any programming language?   I want to know only concept not the implementation Okay I'm giving you the one minute   Hmm  sir can I write something    Yes yes but I need only logic right not the coding a code part My name is Gauri shirmali So it gives me a sense of job security to some extent   Okay what are the ethical values Tcs have?   sir like I said there is a work life balance and it a it it promotes like gender equality ,there is no like discrimination on the basis of that   Okay ahhh umm  Gauri tell me what are your future plans?   Sir my future plans sir if I join TCS or otherwise   What are your future plans ?   Sir I want to join a software company and a work for it so a variable in which we will take a random function with the help of random function, we can derive a number between one to six and for the first for the first move, if the numbers random number is six, then we can move like we can keep a counter of the player   Okay yeah   Gauri   Good afternoon sir   Good afternoon ah which domain you feel comfortable?   Ah sir core subject subjects programming C++ , DBMS Yes sir Secondly, they should be like the colleagues and everything should be very frank so that they help you in every way and thirdly  for me there should be a brand name so that there is a satisfaction that yes I have achieved a level and now I can go to the next level   Okay okay Gauri nice talking to you , thankyou sir , and  I request kernel rathor sir to take next part of interview Right Fourthly, as Tcs is a multinational company, I would like to I would have the chance to even uhh go abroad and a meet a people of different nationalities I am from Udaipur Rajasthan And I’ve  also used this skills to build several projects, which include user management project and attendance management project And then now we can predefine the snakes for example, if at if we reach five then the the counter should like increased by 10 blocksYes Gauri tell me tell me something about you   Okay ahh thank you for allowing me to introduce myself And lastly there as Tcs is has been in the industry for almost hundred and fifty years   Sir but I will perform good and I would like from my end there will be no complaints from Tcs   What do you mean by storage classes ?   A storage classes sir im no able to recall ive a   Okay gauri all the best   Thankyou so much   Explore more and more Tcs technical interview questions right? Ok sir They are basically mainly from C and C++ That's for you, what are the three important things ah that ah one should consider before joining any organization as a fresher?   So firstly the one should look if there is a lot to learn from the company, I mean, there should be a very steep like growing curve in the company I'm doing computer science engineering from Geetanjali Institute of technical studies I am a team player and very optimistic in tough times And lastly I would like to say that why not start the journey of my success by the success of joining TCS Thank you so much   Okay so how have you prepared for TCS interview now?   Sir I have an enhanced my technical skills I have been preparing for the core subjects, and I've been doing coding almost every day So I think that I prepared quite well For Tcs Either you are a good candidate or the best for example Google want to hire somebody or they find the candidate which is having the capabilities to get a caror package in a anom   which are the major clients of TCS? Can you name three or four of them?   I'm sorry sir but I'm not aware of the clients Third point is the colleagues there hardraw very futuristic in their skills Secondly, it has a work life balance For example, if the dice value for if if the dice value or the that block value in which the counter is right now is five so I have assigned five already that five is a ladder, so then it will increase and for example if 12 is a snake then I've already defined that at 12 you need to decrement the value by for example FIFO or whatever2 c GPA in 10, standard 73 So I will predefined   where you will predefined these values?   So I can use a dictionary to like if I'm doing in Python then I can use it dictonary   If we are using C then and C++, Java there we doesn't have any dictionary   Then sir we can ah we can use array of arrays and then like make dictionary with the help of arrays   Okay yes can we switch or not there?   switch yes hnn but so we can use but it is too long like we will have to write the code many times in switch   why many times we can define a in switch global or anywhere then we can use it   cause switch for snake and switch for a ladder two separate switches we can use yes sir that we can   ahh so what do you mean by the encapsulation is Divyansh answer is correct4 Cgp ahh percentage in 12 standard   Ok sir   Hua Gauri   Yes sir thoda thoda ah sir we can   Verbaly btao to bus when I can analyze that you are going in the right direction or not And currently I am one of the cultural heads of our students club, So I've I have also participated in several donation camps several donation camps as I am a  a member of the Rotary Club Udaipur, I consider myself as a very focused person, I’ve  and I always work towards my goals and in a very efficient manner Ahh these are my technical skills, coming to my extracurricular activities I love to dance umm particularly semi classical dance5 almost years and a developing my software skills My technical skills include programming in Python, Java, C, c++, databases I am also familiar with web development, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, et cetera   All the best right   Gauri   Yes sir   What is your basically the aim you want to go into software companies or anything more than that?   No sir I want to go into software companies that is aim   okay   So how does TCS fit into your requirement?   Sir tcs changes with technologies according to the needs of the people of the or so there is not a there is no fixed technology that they use they use according to the clients which is very well so the counter will increase by ten block That is the ladder and this way we can like pre define the next So that is the second point I secured 9   Okay sir ill keep that in mind thankyou so much sir all the best thank you   A from my side and rathor sir interview my remark for you definitely you are the good candidate that we have already observed many time ahh technical knowledge I have not checked out your head of department CAC will check it out but a you can easily correct the process   Okay ahh What are the five specific point about Tcs which makes Tcs different from the other IT MNCs?

 I've also participated in smart India hackathons of which ahh in one we also got to the finals
   Okay sir ah so ah firstly a we will the will like a this for example of how how many columns are there for example, I take disk of fifty the maximum we take a fifty and then now we take dice
   Thankyou so much sir   Good afternoon   Good afternoon sir   All prepare   Yes sir   Okay Tell us which other campus interviews Have you appeared for and what has been the results?   So I have interviewed for darnet, which is an depor only and I got selected for it
